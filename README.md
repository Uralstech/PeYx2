# **PeYx2**

## **What is PeYx2?**
**PeYx2 (pronounced like pex) is a Text Editor made with Python.**
It's a successor to [***PeYx***](https://github.com/Uralstech/PeYx). Here are some of it's new features:
- **Code highlighting! *Now for \*any filetype!***
- **Easily changeable fonts and colors!**
- **Better looking graphics!**

## **How do I use PeYx2?**
Here are the shortcuts:
- **Ctrl+n: Create new file**
- **Ctrl+o: Open file**
- **Ctrl+s: Save file**
- **Ctrl+a+s: Save-as file**
- **Ctrl+z: Undo action**
- **Ctrl+y: Redo action**
- **F1: Open link to PeYx2 wiki (coming soon)**
- **F5: Run *\*any* file**

\* - any filetype with a corresponding .langConfig file

All other instructions should be obvious in the UI
### NOTE: **This *should* work on MacOS and Linux, but I haven't tested it.**
